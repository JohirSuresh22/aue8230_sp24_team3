To achieve modular efficiency, the repo only contains package level data. In order to reproduce the results, you can download the packages, place them under your ```catkin_ws/src``` directory and run ```catkin_make```. For example, to run the ```assign2b``` package, first ```git clone``` this repo or download the source code. Next, copy the ```assign2b``` directory to the ```src``` of your catkin workspace and then run ```catkin_make```.

The required videos for assignment 4 can be found inside the folder ```videos```.

## Contents by package:
```assign2b``` - Openloop circle and square trajectory following on a Turtlebot3.

```slam_nav``` - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) using Gmapping and Hector SLAM algorithms followed by navigation in both Gazebo and real world on a Turtlebot3 Burger.

Specific instructions on each package are inside each directory.
